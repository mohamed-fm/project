**Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics** (**STEM**) is an used to group together the distinct **but** related technical disciplines of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology "Technology"), [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering "Engineering"), and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"). The term is typically used in the context of [education policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_policy "Education policy") or [curriculum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum "Curriculum") choices in schools. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns (as a shortage of *STEM*-educated citizens can reduce effectiveness in this area), and immigration policy, with regard to admitting foreign students and tech workers.[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics#cite_note-fas.org-1)

There is no universal agreement on which disciplines are included in STEM; in particular, whether or not the *science* in STEM includes [social sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science "Social science"), such as [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics "Economics"), and [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science "Political science"). In the United States, these are typically included by organizations such as the [National Science Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation "National Science Foundation") (NSF),[\[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics#cite_note-fas.org-1) the [Department of Labor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor "United States Department of Labor")'s [O*Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Information_Network "Occupational Information Network") online database for job seekers,[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics#cite_note-2) and the [Department of Homeland Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security "United States Department of Homeland Security").[\[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics#cite_note-3) In the United Kingdom, the social sciences are categorized separately and are instead grouped with [humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities "Humanities") and [arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art "Art") to form another counterpart [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") [HASS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanities,_arts,_and_social_sciences "Humanities, arts, and social sciences") (humanities, arts, and social sciences), rebranded in 2020 as [SHAPE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Sciences,_Humanities_and_the_Arts_for_People_and_the_Economy "Social Sciences, Humanities and the Arts for People and the Economy") (social sciences, humanities and the arts for people and the economy).[\[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics#cite_note-4)[\[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics#cite_note-5) Some sources also use HEAL (health, education, administration, and literacy) as the counterpart of STEM.[\[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics#cite_note-6)
