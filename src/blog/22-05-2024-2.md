Since the beginning of the world, we humans have always felt a connection with the stars. These distant suns have always inspired our imagination, science, and even mythology and while stars will always fuel our desire to know more and more, we will continue to reach for the stars in the future, but are we really made of stardust?



We think that the universe began around 14 billion years ago, and from what we know back then only the lightest elements existed, such as hydrogen or helium.

The first stars that formed after the Big Bang were 50 times bigger than our Sun and likely formed when the Universe was only 100 million years old.



Most of the elements of our body were formed in stars throughout billions of years and multiple stars' lifetimes. The exact lifetime of a star depends on its size: massive stars use up their fuel quickly, which means they last only a few hundred thousand years, which is a minimal period compared to the smaller stars that use their fuel more slowly and will shine for several billion years.



When it comes to the human body the majority of what makes us up comes from supernovas and it is proved that every element required to make a DNA is found in the aftermath of exploding stars, so yes, we could say we are made of stardust.
